Analysis of single cell proteomic data to understand mechanisms of oncogenic transformation and how to control them. Basically mapping cell signalling pathways for both luminal and basal subtypes of breast cancer, and using systems biology techniques to identify interventions for reversing cancerous signalling states.

This project won Best Overall Individual at the annual BT Young Scientist competition (national science fair in Ireland).
